CS5100 Artificial Intelligence Final Project

To play the Tetris game, this project uses five separate progressive AI agents. Using feature-based search at a depth of two, the depth-limited greedy agent searches. To train ideal weights, the reinforcement learning agent employs feature-based Q-learning. These two agents can continue playing the game indefinitely.

This project aims to create an autonomous Tetris player in the form of a TetrAIs AI agent. We have used five distinct agents and various AI methods, such as greedy, depth-limited greedy search, and feature-based Q-learning, to accomplish this goal. Every strategy builds on the one before it.

Applicability in the present:
Research on Tetris AI is still important nowadays. With millions of players worldwide, Tetris is a well-liked game, and there’s rising interest in employing AI to create fresh, creative games. Tetris AI is a useful resource for academics researching machine learning and AI algorithms.
To prevail in a Tetris match, we must create agents that can:
• Clear lines quickly and effectively
• Refrain from making holes in the game board.
• Generate replicable outcomes (so we can take note of their achievements and mistakes).
• Take a video of them playing so we can review it later.
